    <h2>Website 1 Critque - Trader Joe's</h2>
    <h4>http://www.traderjoes.com/</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>My first impression of the website was its organized creative nature.</li>
        <li>They have links on the side of the website with text in the middle. Information links for the website and about Trader Joe's was on the top right of the website.</li>
        <li>The structure of the website made sense. Wasn't confusing to identify what each link or group of text was used for. Very informative.</li>
        <li>The graphics of the site definitely enhance the website. Not too much graphic to confuse the user and not too little to bore you.</li>
        <li>The website did not take long too load.</li>
        <li>The color of the text and background imaging went well together in a way that made the text easy to read.</li>
        <li>The website had a search bar in the top right below the information links. They also had a three bar menu above the links on the left of the website.</li>
        <li>The color scheme was red, white, green, and yellow. The colors were repeated on the page but some colors more than others.</li>
        <li>The website responded well the smaller window sizes. The website wasn't the most responsive but in a good way that didn't make using the website too confusing.</li>
        <li>The wesbite didn't have anything unique. It is what I would imagine as typical.</li>

    <h2>Website 2 Critque - Utah National Parks</h2>
    <h4>http://www.utah.com/nationalparks/</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>My first impression of the website was its simplicity and basic needs for what it take to create a website.</li>
        <li>They have links on the bottom of the website with text below a background picture. Information links for lodging, tour guides, events, and destinations was on the top of the website.</li>
        <li>The structure of the website made sense. Wasn't confusing to identify what each link or group of text was used for. Very informative. However would it would be nice to have some extra color and graphic design on the website</li>
        <li>The graphics of the site were not very exciting. Not too much graphic to confuse the reader.</li>
        <li>The website did not take long too load.</li>
        <li>The color of the text and background imaging went well together, but not much of a color scheme to begin with.</li>
        <li>The website had a search bar in the top right. </li>
        <li>The color scheme was black, white, and red. The colors weren't much beyond the color white.</li>
        <li>The website did not respond very well to size manipulation. When adjusting the size it made the website hard to read and use.</li>
        <li>The wesbite didn't have anything unique.</li>
